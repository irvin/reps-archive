                <p>It brings us great sadness to share with you the recent news about two of our dear Reps we will so fondly remember. Nagarjuna Verma and Rahid Hasan of the Mozilla South Asia community are no longer with us. </p>
<p>Both passings are extremely sad, for it was not their time. They had so much to contribute to the world, to the society, and to the Web – as they so passionately continued to do. They’ve inspired many Mozillians, and even though we have a heavy heart, we know that their inspiration, legacy and memory will sustain us moving forward.</p>

                <p>Shreyas Narayanan Kutty came to Reps as an already inspirational leader and role model in the Firefox Student Ambassadors program. In addition to organizing a number of successful MozCafes, Shreyas has led a charge to empower kids on the web through the Webmaker initiative 'Kidzilla' and a longer-term call to action in schools to start Webmaker Clubs.</p>
<p>Shreyas has inspired others in his community and across the world with blog posts and photos and <a href="https://dunebuggie.makes.org/thimble/LTE5MzM3MDUyMTY=/kidzilla-teaching-kit">a teaching kit</a> which have been featured in <a href="https://blog.webmaker.org/community-literacies-2">Mozilla publications</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to his FSA and Reps contribution, Shreyas has been a key participant in Hive India and most recently, Mozcamp Beta, where his Popcorn video <a href="https://dunebuggie.makes.org/popcorn/24hg">'I am Mozillian'</a>, featuring 19 different states of India stole the show.</p>

<p>Passionate about free and open technologies, Nino continues to be the driving force behind the event (<a href="http://openway.si">Open Way</a>), which is growing every year and has just completed its 4th incarnation. As the main community builder of the <a href="http://mozilla.si">Mozilla Slovenija</a> community, he made sure Firefox release party was part of the conference, too.</p>

                <p>This month's Rep is Michael Kohler from Berne in Switzerland. He started
contributing Firefox patches as a teenager in 2008. Four years later he
became a Mozilla Rep.
Michael is continuously firing up the Swiss community. Most recently he
organized swag for an event in Zurich which was all about Rust. Since
Michael is super-charged with organization superpowers, he also started
to set up events in Germany and Austria. Among his 2014 achievements is
the successful organization of the German-speaking Community Meeting in
Berlin in early February. This makes Michael one of the few people who
manage to pull off events in three different countries within a couple
of months.
Further broadening our community growth Michael is reaching out a wide
range of Mozillians covering areas such as L10N, hacking and Webmaker.
Please join us in wishing Michael all the best for his future Mozilla
endeavors!</p>

<p>From organizing over 6 major events, participating in more the 12 events in all and recruiting 6+ Mozillians within his short tenure of becoming a rep, he's been an absolute trailblazer from the Mozilla India community.
