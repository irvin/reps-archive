                <p>Faye, the first female Mozilla Rep in the Philippines, is playing an instrumental role in connecting the Philippine community to local schools and colleges by means of coordinating events. She is also part of the [Webmaker effort] (https://reps.mozilla.org/e/womoz-2013-maker-party/ by leading Maker Parties <a href="http://www.mozillaphilippines.org/maker-party-2013-alphaland-2/">all over the Philippines</a> after hosting last year the biggest Webmaker Party in Asia (with videocon to several countries). She has been providing great input into the WoMoz Community, especially in Philippines, where she organized a <a href="%5Bhttps_/reps.mozilla.org/e/womoz-in-the-philippines-kick-off-event/index.html">kick-off event</a> and she represented the Mozilla local community in the very first <a href="http://www.mozillaphilippines.org/mozilla-philippines-supports-web-chixies-meetup/">Web Chixies Philippines meetup</a>. You can check out the interview she gave to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKuo1LIoC8s">nationwide TV</a>. regarding WoMoz efforts. Congrats Faye for this outstanding work!</p>

                <p>A rep, a mentor, a webmaker, a Mozillian, a passionate community builder is what defines best Henrik Mitsch. 
Sharing his time between the Swiss, Austrian and German communities (all of them are now part of the broader German-speaking community) Henrik has done a stellar job supporting these communities since joining the program two years ago. Lately, he has been doing outstanding work around Firefox OS and supporting local developer communities in the above-mentioned countries to organize several App Days in <a href="../e/firefox-os-app-day-vienna/index.html">Vienna</a>  and <a href="../e/firefox-os-app-in-a-box-day-switzerland/index.html">Zurich</a> , successfully spurring local developers to create new web apps for Firefox OS. As if Henrik was not busy enough, he recently participated in Mozilla's Summit 2013 Planning Assembly in Paris as an official delegate, providing valuable insights and input, but also driving a brainstorm to prepare for Mozilla Reps sessions at the Summit. Please join the Council in congratulating Henrik for being Rep of Month for June 2013 !</p>

<p>Active community member, he participated or/and organized during the last two months different community meetups and IT events. We note with pleasure the long list of events where he was involved on his <a href="../u/alex_lakatos/index.html">reps profile</a>.

From QA to Marketing with an amazing contribution to the Mozilla Developer Network l10n and Firefox OS, he has more than one string in his bow. Rep and mentor in Spain since June 2011, he has led Mozilla Hispano's events strategy and has helped organise many events in Spain but also overseas, with a particular focus in 2013 on Fx OS activities, naturally :). In the past months, he has has done particularly phenomenal work coordinating Mozilla's presence in Spain like the <a href="../e/ebe-2012-evento-blog-espana/index.html">EBE conference</a> in Sevilla, the <a href="../e/firefox-os-app-days-madrid/index.html">Firefox OS Team Workshop</a> in Madrid or <a href="../e/sherpa-web-summit/index.html">Sherpa Summit Bilbao</a> with Mitchell Baker.</p>

<p>The Mozilla Reps Council decided to skip the standard procedure for selecting the "Rep of the month" for February and March, and agreed that we should give a special "Reps of the Month" award to all 5 Reps who represented our volunteer community at MWC 2013 and for their post-event work. </p>

Despite spreading Fx OS love around the clock for 5 days straight, the group still found the energy to create a great <a href="http://youtu.be/uHWwbxfMTbU">recap video</a> for the broader community.  Please join the Mozilla Reps Council in congratulating the "fantastic five" for their stellar work at MWC and being recognised as "Reps of the Month" for February and March 2013.</p>

                <p>Paris-based journalist by day, hard core Mozillian by night (and on weekends!), Claire (aka Clarista) has been doing phenomenal work for Mozilla since 2009. Claire is probably best known for <a href="http://bonjourmozilla.fr/">Bonjour Mozilla</a>, the website she updates daily to showcase Mozillians from all over the world. But BM is only one of many of her activites for Mozilla. From localization, to marketing, to WoMoz, to event organization to FOSS activism, Claire has been helping push the Mozilla project forward in a variety of ways across dozens of countries in Europe and Africa. More recently, Claire went above and beyond to help organize Mozilla's <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/firefox-os-app-days-its-a-wrap/">Paris Firefox OS App Day</a> and our participation at <a href="../e/fosdem-2013/index.html">FOSDEM</a>! In light of this Rep awesomeness, the Mozilla Reps Council is thrilled to name her Rep of the Month for January 2013. Félicitations Claire!</p>

                <p>Based in Erode, Tamilnadu, India, Gauthamraj has been actively spreading the word and getting people involved in the Mozilla project in schools, internet cafés, mobile shops and basically wherever he can. </p>
<p>Lately, Gauthamraj has been particularly interested in <a href="https://webmaker.org/">webmaker</a> tools and has hosted many training workshops of popcorn, thimble and x-ray goggle in local schools. Recently, he created a Web Page for Mozilla Community Erode using  the Hackasaurus Tool kit. He says on <a href="http://ant2android.com/">his blog</a>: "I hacked this page to illustrate the freedom given by Mozilla  to people on using the Internet." </p>
<p>When not getting his hands dirty hacking webmaker tools, Gauthamraj leads the localization effort of <a href="http://support.mozilla.org">SUMO</a> in Tamil language( ta-IN). He's also a regional localization lead for Tamil for the reps community project NeMo. </p>
<p>Perhaps Gauthamraj's most recent accomplishment was to be featured in a great blog post by fellow Mozillian Laura Hilliger, where she shows just how amazing Gauthamraj' contribution to the project has been and how it has affected an entire network of people in India. Check out the <a href="http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/the-power-of-contribution/">blog post</a>, it makes for a great read. </p>
<p>Keep up the great work Gauthamraj and congrats on being selected as the Rep of the Month for September 2012! </p>

Helping to build a vibrant Mozilla community in North America is his ambition and so if you're in this part of the world, make sure to get in touch with Benjamin, he'll most certainly be able to point you to a great conference or Foss happening in your area you should check out. </p>

<p>One of the first Mozillians to sign up to the Reps program in the Philippines, Bob has been doing outstanding work to educate Filipinos about Mozilla's mission and open web technologies. Just last month, he was involved in <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/bobreyes/r/2012/June/">five events</a> in different corners of the country. It's also safe to say that Bob has perfected the art of "ReMo reporting". A good illustration of this is his blog post after returning from a <a href="http://www.bobreyes.com/myblog/2012/05/25/moztour-goes-to-zamboanga-city/">Moz Tour in the town of Zamboanga</a>.</p>

Deb has been a web aficionado and tech evangelist for some time now. </p>
<p>Deb recently organized a most excellent Firefox add-ons workshop at the Madras Institue of Technology, in Chennai, India. The room was packed and participants walked away with a much deeper understanding of add-ons development, many of whom are now on their way to becoming awesome add-ons developers. Not only was the event a great success, but Soumya did a fantastic job documenting through a great blog post, flickr, notes, slideshare, all for the benefit of the broader community. Documentation is a pillar of the Mozilla Reps program, and Soumya did an great job bringing his add-ons workshop across Mozilla universe.
