SUMMARY:Defend yourself
DESCRIPTION:This curriculum was created for a Defense and Detoxification e
 vent for women in Mexico City to teach digital women how to protect themse
 lves online. The curriculum can be tailored for women anywhere.\n\nThis is
  not the Internet I want for women. I do not want us to struggle to mainta
 in our online presence or fear what could happen to us if we stayed in dan
 gerous spaces. I want an ecosystem that includes our differences.\n\nWe ar
 e far from achieving this.
