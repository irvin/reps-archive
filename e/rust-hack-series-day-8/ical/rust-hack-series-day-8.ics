SUMMARY:Rust Hack Series - Day 8
DESCRIPTION:It is a series of part of the Rust Hack Series\,2018. (https:/
 /reps.mozilla.org/e/rust-hack-series/) This week would be based on Game De
 velopment. Rust is potentially an ideal language for Game Development. Its
  emphasis on low-level memory safe programming promise a better developmen
 t process\, less debugging time\, and better end result. While the ecosyst
 em is still very young\, you can find enough libraries and game engines to
  sink your teeth into doing some slightly experimental gamedev.
