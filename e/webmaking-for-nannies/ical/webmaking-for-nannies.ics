SUMMARY:Webmaking for Nannies
DESCRIPTION:This is the second of the Webmaking for Nannies series. The co
 ncept is pretty simple: Enable nannies to become Webmaker coaches to their
  wards. The learning setting for them is very informal and the expectation
  ranges from sharing some bits of info about Webmaker initiatives to doing
  demos of the tools. The over-arching goal is to get their wards intereste
 d and motivated about Webmaking.
