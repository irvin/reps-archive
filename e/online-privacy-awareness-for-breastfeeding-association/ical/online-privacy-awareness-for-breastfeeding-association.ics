SUMMARY:Online Privacy Awareness for Breastfeeding Association
DESCRIPTION:Indonesia Breastfeeding Association have about 40 women acting
  as webmaster for their website (http://aimi-asi.org)\, including the bran
 ch website.\nI would like to give awareness about online privacy to all of
  them so that they can spread the knowledge about online privacy to other 
 association members. The main point for this one is Do Not Track and Light
 beam.\n\nAdditionally I can give them some info about how to contribute to
  Mozilla and maybe some introduction about WoMoz.
