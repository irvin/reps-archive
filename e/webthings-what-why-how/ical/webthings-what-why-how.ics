SUMMARY:WebThings - What? Why? How?
DESCRIPTION:The Web of Things connects real-world objects to the World Wid
 e Web.\n\nThe idea of the Web of Things is to create a decentralized Inter
 net of Things by giving things URLs on the web to make them linkable and d
 iscoverable\, and defining a standard data model and APIs to make them int
 eroperable.\n\nThe Web of Things is intended as a unifying application lay
 er for the Internet of Things (IoT)\, linking together multiple underlying
  IoT protocols using existing web technologies.
