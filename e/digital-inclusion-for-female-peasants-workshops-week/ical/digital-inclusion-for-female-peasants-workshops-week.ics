LOCATION:Vila Jardim Gaurama Telecentro\, Gaurama\, Brazil
SUMMARY:Digital inclusion for female peasants workshops week
DESCRIPTION:The first WoMoz event in BR will happen in a small city on the
  countryside called Gaurama. It has only 5000 inhabitants and discovered t
 he importance that learning the web can have on their inhabitants&#39; lives\,
  and it&#39;s putting a lot of effort on that\, as the revitalization of the c
 ity&#39;s telecentro on the countryside and the digital baptism of almost 10% 
 of its population\, focusing on females. This is undoubtedly an event to b
 e remembered in the city surroundings and maybe even in broader circles
