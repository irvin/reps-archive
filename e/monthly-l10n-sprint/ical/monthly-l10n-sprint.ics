SUMMARY:Monthly l10n Sprint
DESCRIPTION:During the Summer Code campaign we had a few localizers presen
 t which showed an interest in doing that more. So we decided to create a m
 onthly sprint for them to meet and work/review together. This being our fi
 rst sprint\, we want to make it special. We&#39;ll be translating together SUM
 O KB articles in a comfortable room in a local Cafe.
