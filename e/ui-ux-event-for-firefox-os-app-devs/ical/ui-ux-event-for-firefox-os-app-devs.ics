SUMMARY:UI/UX event for Firefox OS app Devs
DESCRIPTION:Firefox OS successfully lunched in Bangladesh. Already lots of
  local apps and content available at Firefox Marketplace. And the number o
 f apps are growing. But we noticed the available apps does not looks good 
 and attractive because of bad UI/UX design of the apps. The main reason is
 \, lack of enough knowledge and capacity of UI/UX design of the developers
 . To increase the awareness and capacity of developers on UI/UX for Firefo
 x OS apps we planned this event.
