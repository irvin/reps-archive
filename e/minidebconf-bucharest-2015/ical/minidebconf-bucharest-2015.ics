LOCATION:The University Politehnica of Bucharest\, Bucharest\, Romania
SUMMARY:MiniDebConf Bucharest 2015
DESCRIPTION:On the weekend of May 16th and 17th\, Bucharest will host a Mi
 ni DebConf with both talks and social events\, to which everyone in Debian
  is invited but the speakers in the talks are all people who identify them
 selves as female. We consider this important to:\n\n    Encourage women wh
 o haven&#39;t yet given their first DebConf talk\n    Provide role models for 
 women who are interested in contributing\n    Debunk the myth that there a
 re not enough women who can give talks in DebConf
