SUMMARY:MozCamp at DMIT\, Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan\, New Delhi
DESCRIPTION:DMITs is all about technologies and its aspects\, And what do 
 we do there? Hack it and most important Learn. School students are an inte
 gral part of any community\, but most of the students aren&#39;t aware about w
 hat technologies they must use and the power and potential they behold. DM
 ITs Cross the barriers and bring the potential out of them by organizing s
 everal events and talks for them. From the community point of view\, this 
 could be a major contribution towards itself.\n
