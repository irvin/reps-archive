LOCATION:Chilli&#39;s Ice Cream Parlour\, Rajshahi\, Bangladesh
SUMMARY:Rajshahi AppDev&#39;s Meetup
DESCRIPTION:RUET is one of the very first Universities in Bangladesh that 
 was lucky enough to get a AppTrain Day. But\, it is sad that We&#39;re losing 
 Devs from RUET because of the communication lag and some of Devs lag prope
 r guide line so they loose interest over creating apps. We&#39;ll try to fill 
 up the gaps we&#39;ve found as much as we can.  \n\nInitially meant for RUET A
 pp devs\, we thought inviting all of the Devs and beta testers (QA) is a c
 ooler idea.
