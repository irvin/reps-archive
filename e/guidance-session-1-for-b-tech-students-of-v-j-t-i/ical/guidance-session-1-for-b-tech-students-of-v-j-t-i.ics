SUMMARY:Guidance Session #1 (for B.Tech Students of V.J.T.I.)
DESCRIPTION:Many students demonstrated their interest after my Introductor
 y talk at  V.J.T.I. Some of them wanted to get started with Mozilla Codeba
 se. So\, I would met them during some free time and introduce them to code
 base. So\, this is first session of this kind where students would meet me
  in bits and pieces and I would help them getting started.
