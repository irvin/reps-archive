SUMMARY:Rust Hack Series - Week 4
DESCRIPTION:It is a series of part of the Rust Hack Series\,2018. (https:/
 /reps.mozilla.org/e/rust-hack-series/)\nThis week would be based on Game D
 evelopment.  Rust is potentially an ideal language for Game Development.\n
 \nIts emphasis on low-level memory safe programming promise a better devel
 opment process\, less debugging time\, and better end result.\n\nWhile the
  ecosystem is still very young\, you can find enough libraries and game en
 gines to sink your teeth into doing some slightly experimental gamedev.
