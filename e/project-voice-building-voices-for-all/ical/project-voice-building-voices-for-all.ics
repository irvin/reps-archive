SUMMARY:Project Voice - Building Voices for All
DESCRIPTION:We are celebrating the World Wide Web 30th Anniversary\, but t
 he most of the content on the Internet is in English 50-60% and the native
  speakers are 5-6% of the world population. With voice assistants this bec
 omes a problem for non-native speakers which forces them to rely on a fore
 ign language to learn. And the existing technology doesn&#39;t support languag
 es which are diverse and also underserved in many communities which crippl
 e them for using the technology.
