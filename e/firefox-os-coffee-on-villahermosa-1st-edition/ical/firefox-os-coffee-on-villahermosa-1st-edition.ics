SUMMARY:Firefox OS Coffee on Villahermosa (1st edition)
DESCRIPTION:We&#39;re going to have a meeting with a small group of people at 
 a local Coffee on Villahermosa to show Firefox OS and make some demos.\n\n
 The idea is to begin creating community about Firefox OS and eventually re
 ach some app developers interested in the OS in Villahermosa.\n\nThe Coffe
 &#39;s owner is a Free Software fan\, so I think places like this one are part
 icularly good hosts.
