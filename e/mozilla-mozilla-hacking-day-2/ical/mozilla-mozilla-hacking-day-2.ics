SUMMARY:Mozilla - Mozilla Hacking Day 2
DESCRIPTION:Hacking Day #2 in Berlin. This is the follow-up of our first H
 acking Day this year. This time\, we&#39;ll have pre-defined tables and do all
  the things regarding this topic there. Like that we can be as specific as
  needed\, instead of having general talks without much attendee participat
 ions.\n\nEver wanted to hack on an open source project but didn&#39;t know how
  to start? At the Mozilla Hacking Day (2nd Edition) we will show you how t
 o get hands on our projects.
