SUMMARY:Dark Funnel in Colombia
DESCRIPTION:We want to understand where Firefox downloads come from. So fa
 r\, we know that 30% of Firefox installs come from the official Mozilla we
 bsite or from known partners. The other 70% come from mystery download sou
 rces that we call “the dark funnel”. Some are friendly sites\, but oth
 ers put users at risk of getting old editions\, a bad experience or even m
 alicious installs. Help Firefox understand what’s in the dark funnel\, b
 y participating in this campaign and spreading the light!
