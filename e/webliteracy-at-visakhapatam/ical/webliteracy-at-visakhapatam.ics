SUMMARY:WebLiteracy at Visakhapatam
DESCRIPTION:When a weak Wifi signal reminds us about the importance of Int
 ernet\, there are millions of people who don&#39;t even know about its existen
 ce\, \n           The motto of this event is to educate as many students a
 s possible about the basics of Internet. Visakhapatnam is proclaimed as th
 e best city of Andhra Pradesh\, but still there are hundreds of students w
 ho are under privileged\, who don&#39;t have the access to Internet. We would 
 move to them to teach the basics of Internet.
