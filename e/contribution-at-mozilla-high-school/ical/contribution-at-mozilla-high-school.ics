SUMMARY:Contribution at Mozilla: High School
DESCRIPTION:I will present Mozilla projects and volunteering opportunities
  at a local IT High School. Since most of the students from this school ar
 e pursuing informatics and technical domains it&#39;s a great opportunity to p
 resent what opportunities does Mozilla offer and how can they get involved
 . Also I will present the local community and our projects.
