SUMMARY:Webmaker Portuguese Localizathon
DESCRIPTION:Webmaker is not yet localized to Portuguese. This is so so sad
  :(\n\nYou know\, teaching and learning goes way better when it&#39;s easy to 
 communicate\, and language is a big barrier for truly awesome communicatio
 n. So\, localizing Webmaker to Portuguese is a must have!\n\nLet&#39;s get thi
 s localized and help everyone that&#39;s willing to teach and learn the Web in
  Portuguese! :D\n\nIf you need a prize for this\, you&#39;ll get a hug from Pa
 naggio as soon as you two meet. Promise!
