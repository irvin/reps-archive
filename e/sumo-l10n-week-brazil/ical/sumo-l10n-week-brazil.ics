SUMMARY:SUMO &amp; L10n Week Brazil
DESCRIPTION:Starting with Firefox version 52\, the new releases will bring
  new features to users and developers. The L10n pt-BR team made some chang
 es in the nomenclature of some interface items and\, consequently\, SUMO a
 rticles need to follow such changes. That&#39;s why we launched this campaign 
 to update all articles about Firefox in SUMO&#39;s knowledge base.
