SUMMARY:Firefox OS App days and webmaker party
DESCRIPTION:There is an &#34;Expériences numériques&#34; (Digital experiment) he
 ld in Lyon in a public digital space. It&#39;s generally oriented towards a no
 vice audience\, but the organizer asked me if we could set up something fo
 r developers.\nI agreed and promised that we would organize a Firefox OS A
 pp days in addition to the webmaker party event (which fits better to the 
 expected audience). I also gathered a few developers who promised to come 
 and develop apps.
