SUMMARY:MozCoffee-meetup Dhaka
DESCRIPTION:We didn&#39;t meet since July after MozIftar. So we need to meet a
 ll reps and mozillians again. Recently Mozilla Bangladesh has two new reps
  and many more new mozillians. This meetup would be a perfect place to int
 roduce them. The meetup would be an excellent opportunity to hear from the
  Summit 2013 attendees about their experiences and what they learn from th
 e Summit. And as obvious a meetup is a good opportunity to discuss future 
 plans and activities.
