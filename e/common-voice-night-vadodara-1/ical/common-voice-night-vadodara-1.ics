SUMMARY:Common Voice Night - Vadodara
DESCRIPTION:Common Voice is a project to help make voice recognition open 
 to everyone. To create voice systems\, developers need an extremely large 
 amount of voice data. Most of the data used by large companies aren’t av
 ailable to the majority of people. We think that stifles innovation. So we
 ’ve launched Common Voice\, a project to help make voice recognition ope
 n and accessible to everyone! Raise your voice and get involved!
