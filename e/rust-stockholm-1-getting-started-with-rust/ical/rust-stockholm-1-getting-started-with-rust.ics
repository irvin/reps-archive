SUMMARY:Rust Stockholm #1:  Getting started with Rust
DESCRIPTION:Welcome fellow Rustaceans! :)\n\nI think a good theme for a fi
 rst meetup could be to talk about what makes Rust great and how to learn i
 t coming from different backgrounds.\n\nIf anyone has a good first rust pr
 oject story to tell that would fit perfectly too I think.\n\nA few I have 
 in mind for the future:\n-Rust on the server/web\n-Rust community\n-Rust e
 verywhere (cross compile story in general)\n-Functional Rust\n-Servo
