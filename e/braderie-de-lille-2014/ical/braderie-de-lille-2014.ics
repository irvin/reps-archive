SUMMARY:Braderie de Lille 2014
DESCRIPTION:Like each year\, the local Chtinux LUG in Lille (Northern Fran
 ce) invites us to its &#34;free software village&#34; in the middle of the Braderi
 e de Lille\, a gigantic flea market occupying the whole city center during
  the first weekend of September. More than two million people are expected
  to visit the braderie.\n\nA local volunteer presence for Mozilla was ther
 e in 2008\, 2009\, 2011 and 2012. This year is especially important for us
  since Firefox OS just launched in France and this is a popular event.
