LOCATION:Universiti Malaysia Sarawak\, Kuching\, Malaysia
SUMMARY:Mozilla\, HTML5 and Its Hidden Potential
DESCRIPTION:Universiti Malaysia Sarawak is a local university in Malaysia.
  I was invited by one of the lecturer in this university to collaborate te
 aching on web development. As a guest speaker\, I find it feasible to orga
 nize an event based on HTML5 and have hands on session on building Firefox
  OS app to expose the undergraduates to Mozilla and its technologies.
