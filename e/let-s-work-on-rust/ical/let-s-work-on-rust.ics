SUMMARY:Let&#39;s Work on Rust
DESCRIPTION:Previously\, we had a comprehensive introductory session on Ru
 st. https://reps.mozilla.org/e/hello-rust/ Though it went good\, it wasn&#39;t
  enough to get everyone into Rust straightaway. So\, let&#39;s have a workshop
 ! We&#39;ll go through most of the basic features of Rust (and a few more) wit
 h appropriate examples\, and we&#39;ll try to finish a tiny hobby project by t
 he end of the day.
