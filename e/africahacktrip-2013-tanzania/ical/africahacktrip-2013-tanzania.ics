SUMMARY:AfricaHackTrip 2013 - Tanzania
DESCRIPTION:Since submarine fibre-optic cables connect East Africa to fast
 \, reliable and affordable Internet\, the region&#39;s tech scene has been lea
 pfrogging: from no net to mobile net in 4 years. We have been working with
  people from all over the world\, but not yet with hackers from Africa. We
  want to change that. We believe that it takes personal contacts to establ
 ish lasting networks. So we decided to just go there.
