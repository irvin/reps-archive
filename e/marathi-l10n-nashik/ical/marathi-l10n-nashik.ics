DESCRIPTION:This event will be the first ever Localization event in Nashik

 on how to translate in Marathi language. This event will help set up a Mar
 athi localizers team.\n\nThe added advantage of having this event now is t
 hat the Firefox OS is out recently\, and it needs localization in Marathi 
 as well as some other regional languages as well. So this event may come i
 n handy as it will help Firefox OS become more user friendly.
