SUMMARY:Cuba Conference
DESCRIPTION:&#34;Unfortunately the majority of large Free Software Conferences
  take place in rich countries. People from poor countries like Cuba normal
 ly are prevented to participate not only by financial reasons but also by 
 denying the entry visa to countries like USA\, Canada or most European cou
 ntries. So we decided to turn it upside down and have an International Fre
 e Software Conference in Havana\, Cuba. We invite free software enthusiast
 s from all over the world to participate&#34;
