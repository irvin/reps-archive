SUMMARY:Million Mask March - Zurich
DESCRIPTION:Currently there is a discussion in Swiss parliament to reform 
 the current law regarding digital law enforcement. In privacy-concerned ci
 rcles this reform is seen as a massive decrement of privacy of Swiss peopl
 e. One of the means to increase the enforcement would be a trojan horse-li
 ke tool which would be installed on people&#39;s computers. Therefore there wi
 ll be a demonstration in Zurich to get us heard and get as many attention 
 to the topic as possible\, so not only geeks see the problem.
