SUMMARY:Remote Maker Party
DESCRIPTION:We are organizing this event for some of our new contributors 
 who are unaware of maker party.\n\nGetting a venue\, gathering everyone to
 gether has often been a problem both from the logistical view point as wel
 l as for the participants. We thus thought of experimenting with an online
  version of Maker Party\, where anyone with a decent internet connection\,
  from any part of the world can join in and make the web.
