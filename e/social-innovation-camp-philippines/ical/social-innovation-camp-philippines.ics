SUMMARY:Social Innovation Camp Philippines
DESCRIPTION:Social Innovation Camp brings together software developers and
  designers with people who understand a social problem to help build web a
 nd mobile solutions to social challenges.\n\nWe think the web and related 
 technologies hold huge potential to create change in many different ways: 
 how people hold those in positions of power accountable\; who they rely on
  to provide the services they need to live healthy\, happy lives\; or how 
 they make a difference to something that affects them.
