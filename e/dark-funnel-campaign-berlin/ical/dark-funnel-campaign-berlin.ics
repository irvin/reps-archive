SUMMARY:Dark Funnel Campaign - Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Help Firefox understand what’s in the dark funnel\, by parti
 cipating in this campaign and spreading the light! We want to understand w
 here Firefox downloads come from.\n\nSo far\, we know that 30% of Firefox 
 installs come from the official Mozilla website or from known partners. Th
 e other 70% come from mystery download sources that we call “the dark fu
 nnel”. Some are friendly sites\, but others put users at risk of getting
  old editions\, a bad experience or even malicious installs.
