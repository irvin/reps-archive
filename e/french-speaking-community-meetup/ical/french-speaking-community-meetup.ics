LOCATION:16 Boulevard Montmartre\, Paris\, France
SUMMARY:French-speaking community meetup 
DESCRIPTION:The French-speaking community is growing and now concerns over
  15 countries. Over 200 people are working together easily because they sh
 are the same language\, and they are contributing more and more. But somet
 imes\, it&#39;s hard because of the distance\, and because of the jet lag. So 
 this event would be a fantastic way to share our knowledge\, and to prepar
 e the future events in these 15 countries\, IRL. We would also work togeth
 er on MDN\, Webmaker\, and of course\, Firefox OS!
