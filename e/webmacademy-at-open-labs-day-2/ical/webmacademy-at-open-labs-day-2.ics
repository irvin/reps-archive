SUMMARY:Webmacademy at Open Labs - Day 2
DESCRIPTION:After the success of the first Maker Party some of the attende
 es of that event had the idea of a series of Maker Parties in a more inten
 sive manner\, in order to be more fluent in web literacy. This is how the 
 idea of Webmacademy was born. Webmacademy is a series of workshops that wi
 ll teach the attendees code philosophy and web literacy. It is mainly focu
 sed on the usage of  the Webmaker platform while still using the MDN resou
 rces as a reference for HTML\, CSS and Javascript.
