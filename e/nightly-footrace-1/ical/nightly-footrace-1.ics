SUMMARY:Nightly Footrace #1
DESCRIPTION:As we all know we have a great Mozilla community around India.
  We have a large number of dedicated students\, developers and evangelists
  who are really passionate about Mozilla. We have seen that very few peopl
 e in India actually know about Firefox Nightly Desktop.So it needs a littl
 e bit of general promotion\, which will pump to bring a good number of tec
 h-savvy\, power users who will be our active community members.
