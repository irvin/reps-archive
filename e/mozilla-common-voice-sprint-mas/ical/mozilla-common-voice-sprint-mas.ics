SUMMARY:Mozilla Common Voice Sprint - MAS
DESCRIPTION:Mozilla&#39;s Common Voice is the project that aims to unlock and 
 open the voice ecosystem. It needs YOUR help to advance English voice coll
 ection and get to the next level. In order for a language to be usable by 
 speech recognition engines we need at least 2000 hours of voice collected 
 from at least 1000 diverse people\, and we think communities are the only 
 ones that can enable this diversity.
