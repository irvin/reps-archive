SUMMARY:Webmaker for Nannies
DESCRIPTION:The concept is pretty simple: Enable nannies to become Webmake
 r coaches to their wards.\n\nThe learning setting for them is very informa
 l and the expectation ranges from sharing some bits of info about Webmaker
  initiatives to doing demos of the tools. The over-arching goal is to get 
 their wards interested and motivated about Webmaking.\n\nThe main benefit 
 of this is a win-win situation for both the nanny and the ward: Both of th
 em gain knowledge about Webmaking.
