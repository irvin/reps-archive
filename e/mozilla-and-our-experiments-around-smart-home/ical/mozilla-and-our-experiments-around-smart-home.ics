SUMMARY:Mozilla and our experiments around Smart Home
DESCRIPTION:Last december it became clear that Mozilla will shift its focu
 s to Connected Devices. In\nthe first two months of 2016 it became clear a
 s well\, that Mozilla will sunset Firefox OS after the version 2.6 release
  in May. Even though the smartphone might still be relevant in the IoT\, w
 e will focus on how we can use the power of the Web for IoT. In this talk 
 Michael will show a few demos (might still be alpha by then) and show you 
 the new\, exiting path for the future.
