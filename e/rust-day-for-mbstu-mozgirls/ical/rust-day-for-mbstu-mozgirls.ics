SUMMARY:Rust day for MBSTU MozGirls
DESCRIPTION:Girls are far behind in contributing to code and open source a
 t MBSTU. Based on the previous experience in Rust event at MBSTU\, this ev
 ent is focused to put those girls at work learning\, creating and sharing 
 some awesome code stuff in RUST.\n\nRust being the safe programming langua
 ge for coders of all expertise levels\, requires mass acknowledgment and a
 wareness throughout the developer and learner community. Minimum requireme
